## Overview

PriceMe is an application made to help Trade Me users make wiser purchasing and selling decisions.

Through the use of displaying otherwise unavailable data, consumers will be able to make informed decisions through purchase history, pricing and historical data.

From both a buyers and sellers standpoint- our app will provide safety for both parties with each knowing they are getting a fair price and a fair deal. Just the way we Kiwi's like it.

## Technology
- **Node.js** was used for handling GET and POST requests on the back-end.
- Many **npm** packages were used to help in processing of the data from the TradeMe API e.g [sprintf-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprintf-js), [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) and [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan).
- **jQuery** was the main JavaScript framework used in the front-end for smooth transitions and making the whole interface more interactive.
- **Chart.js** was the JavaScript library used to generate all the pretty charts, [here's the link](http://www.chartjs.org/).
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** was used on the front-end to make a modern, responsive web interface.
- **Heroku** was used for deloyment and building on to our web server.
- And we obviously used **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for hosting the repository.
